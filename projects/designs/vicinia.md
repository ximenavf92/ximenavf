VICINIA is a new 97-acre master-planned community with a true New Urbanist style, bringing a pedestrian-oriented, human-scale neighborhood to the city's booming far west side. VICINIA needed an informational site with their design guidelines to share with potential developers for the project. They were looking for a site that conveyed their idea in an early stage while providing key information to interested parties.
