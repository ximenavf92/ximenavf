## üóÇÔ∏è Project Overview

A redesign of the UTSA's about suite of pages to provide a broad overview of UTSA. We want our users to gather a basic understanding of UTSA‚Äôs foundation, highlights, unique value propositions (Hispanic serving, community focused, future vision), and directions on how to learn more about the University. The previous About site consisted of a disconnected set of pages with random data and facts about the school with no story or context to some of the statistics and small bits of information. The new site tells a relatable story to prospective students, their parents, potential donors, government officials and other individuals interested in what they UTSA is doing and where they are going.
