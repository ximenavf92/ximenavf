**Â¡Hola hola!** Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This will be my digital space where I write about all things web, design, code, sketchnotes, work, life, games, food, books, and more. It's been a while since I have written anything, let alone share it. Bear with me here, the first many posts won't be great but that's the only way to get better, I suppose. 

Now, I rambleâ€¦

## How did I get here?

I have wanted to design and build my own website for years. Since I graduated college, maybe even before that but to be fair MySpace was enough at the time. In college I started with a Behance portfolio with my student work in hopes of getting that first job, which I did. Then I had a splash page for forever that turned into pretty bad WordPress site. I just gave up a that point. I wasn't a fan of WordPress and used it too much at work. Let's be honest, I didn't really need a CMS like that. I left it alone for a while but I knew I wanted my own site and I wanted more than just a portfolio, but a space of my own where I can share everything from my work, to my side projects and other ramblings. 

At the agency I worked at for a few years I had the opportunity to do everything from print design to social media to websites. I rediscovered my love for the web, both design and code. I have dabbled in code since I was in middle school, maybe even elementary. Built some mini fan sites in Notepad and Dreamweaver, and well there was the MySpace era with the custom themes. I am glad my profile is gone now, no one needs to see that chaos. But, anyway, I always enjoyed building something myself. 

The Graphic Design program in college required various coding classes that almost everyone hated but I loved them. After graduation, I got to work on designing websites and also helped out with modifying WordPress themes to match the client's needs. That's when I realized I missed coding but also that there was *a lot* that I did not know. So, I decided to go back to the basics. I already knew HTML and CSS but, did I really? I went all in on courses, blogs, tutorials, newsletters, live streams, and anything web related I could get my hands on. I learned a lot, turns out things had changed quite a bit since I was coding layouts with Photoshop slices and tables. ðŸ˜‰ Thankfully that is not a thing anymore. Except maybe email, but we are not going there.

As I submerged myself into all the new things in the web world I realized there were many cool things to work with. It was no longer just Bootstrap and jQuery, it was React and Vue and so many other things. It was overwhelming to be honest. I eventually found this old new thing called the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). I won't get into that just yet, that's maybe another post. The point is it got me excited to build for the web again, and that brings me here, to this site. Oof, and *breathe*â€¦

## The game is afoot

Most of what I write here will be about the web, design and code. However, I don't want to limit myself. I don't have a specific goal here but to share my thoughts so I will most likely ramble about many other things as well. Let's see where this goes. 

If you made it to the end of my rambling, gracias, I really appreciate it. There will be many more of these ramblings and hopefully they will get better and maybe even useful for some. I'm looking forward to see where this takes me as I still have so much more I want to learn and do. Anyway, like a good friend says in her [weekly newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/)â€¦Â *Onwards!*
